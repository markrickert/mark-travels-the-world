We've had some form of music categorization and machine learning for a long time now. I can remember listening to Pandora stations in 2005. But those all had to start from a single artist or song or genre. That technology was called the [Music Genome Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_Genome_Project). I want to use this kind of technology to my advantage to build a playlist so amazing that it will practically pick its own songs

The fact is: we can now use computer intelligence to build the ultimate playlist. Let me show you how to do it. I'm using Google Music, but the same methodology should work on any music service that lets you start radio stations from playlists.

My goal will be to put together a playlist that I can just hit "shuffle" and always get great music.

## Seeding

You can start seeding with any songs you like. It can be just a few but I find that 3-5 songs is about the right number. It's enough so the algorithms have something to go on, but leaves it open to having the playlist go in a direction you may not have thought it would go in.

The idea is to get some songs that will set the initial **tone** of the playlist. I like making playlists for my moods or state of mind. I'll name my playlist *Head Shaking & Foot Tapping*. I'm only going to add songs to this playlist that I catch myself grooving to the song and tapping my foot or something similar.

## Listening

No, we're not going to listen to 5 songs on repeat over and over again. This is where the computer inteliigence kicks in. Hit that little button on the playlist's screen that says "RADIO".

Now Google Music is going to make an endless playlist for me of songs it thinks are similar to my seed songs. This is the station I listen to when I want to work on adding music to the playlist.

At the beginning, I add about 10% of songs station plays. I make sure to skip and thumbs-up/down songs where appropriate because these actions are also considered when recommending new songs for you.

Every day, I'll just start the playlist radio again and add songs as I find myself tapping my foot. Every day the algorithm gets better and I find myself adding more and more songs to the playlist. We want to constantly be restarting the playlist so that the algorithm can pick up the newly added songs.

Over the last 2 weeks, *Head Shaking & Foot Tapping* went from 3 songs to 32 songs (thats over two hours of music)!

## Tips for optimal playlist creation

Rework this -----> If you're going to hit "Shuffle" on your new playlist all the time you can just add songs to the playlist and forget about them. But if you really want to control every aspect of your new playlist, add it and then navigate to the playlist and reorder it.

You can add songs to other offshoot playlists. If a song doesn't quite fit the playlist you're trying to create, I usually get 1 or 2 ofshoot playlists from this process that I can start seeding and working with.

## Success

I think that having a playlist big enough so that when you hear something you like and try adding it to he playlist you get a "duplicate song" warning.
