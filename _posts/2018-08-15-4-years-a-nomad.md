## Today marks the 4 year anniversary of my nomadic life. 

> Some might call it a "vanniversary" ðŸ™„

I wrote this post shortly before I gave up "normal life" to live a nomadic existence in a van. The van was purchased and I was in the process of purging almost everything I owned.

Honestly, this has been the best time of my life. It's not always easy, but for what I want out of life, it's the best way for me. All the amazing friends, adventures, and growth in my life have made this one of the most terrifying and epic decisions I've ever made.

I've learned that you don't need *THINGS* to be happy. Just do what makes you happy with people you love. 

Stop trying to keep up with the Jonses.  
Stop comparing yourself to others.  
Stop worrying about the future.  
Stop making excuses.  
Go live your life the way you want to.
