Sometimes I can hardly believe my life. I've got a great career that affords me the ability to travel and do what I love on an almost daily basis, amazing friends from all over the world, and the best family anyone could ever ask for.

My life has changed in so many ways in the last 3 years. I never imagined that doing a single tandem skydive would lead me down the path I'm on. Some people never find something they're passionate about. I found parachuting (and air sports in general) at 31 years old and never looked back. This is what I'm meant to do. This is my passion.

I never thought three years ago that I'd become a Skydiver or BASE jumper. Hell, back then I barely had any idea that these were things you could *actually DO* for fun! I'd never thought about jumping from an airplane or fixed object for the first 30 years of my life.

It's amazing what you can do with your life when you let the fear melt away and embrace what makes you happy.

Embrace life.  
Embrace fear.  
Embrace adventure.  
Embrace pushing your limits.  
Embrace your friends and family - because we're not guaranteed tomorrow.
