Over the past two years I've fallen in love with the United States' National Parks. I'm making a goal today to visit all 48 National Parks that lie in the contiguous United States.

In the past year alone I've visited Badlands, Yellowstone, Grand Teton, Glacier, Mt. Rainier, Zion, Bryce Canyon, Capitol Reef, Arches, and Canyonlands. Today I visited Biscayne National Park (where 95% of the park is underwater).

12 down, 36 to go! Lets see how long it takes.
