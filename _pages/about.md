Hi! I'm Mark and I'm a full time digital nomad, world traveler &amp; adventurer!

I live in a converted Sprinter van when I'm in the United States but I travel abroad quite a bit.

I enjoy extreme sports with a focus on flying:

 - Skydiving
 - Wingsuit flying
 - BASE jumping
 - Paragliding
 - Skiing (with the goal to eventually speedride)

Professionally, I have a Bachelors in Management Information Systems. This gives me a firm grasp on both software development and business concepts. I have been working as a software developer for over 15 years, always adapting my skills to new technologies and techniques. I currently work for [Infinite Red](http://infinite.red), a remote work-friendly software and design consulting company.
